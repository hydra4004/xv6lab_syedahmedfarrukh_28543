q1
the function that called syscall: usertrap()

q2
Value of p->trapframe->a7: 0xf
This represents the syscall number for exec().

q3
The value of sstatus is 0x200000022. So the previous mode was user mode.

q4
num = * (int *) 0;
        0x80001cee:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) 
    We can see that lw	a3,0(zero) is the instruction the kernel is panicing at. a3 is the register corresponding to our variable num.

q5
It crashes because it generates an instruction that loads a value from address 0 into a register, which is not mapped in the kernel's virtual address space.

q6
init and PID = 1
